## Troubleshooting Deployment Sync Issues

Let's diagnose why your changes aren't syncing to the live site. Here are the steps to identify and fix the problem:

### Step 1: Check GitHub Actions Status

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click the "Actions" tab** (next to "Pull requests")
3. **Look for recent workflow runs** - you should see:
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmarks = successful deployments
   - ‚ùå Red X marks = failed deployments
   - üü° Yellow circles = currently running

### Step 2: Common Issues to Check

#### Issue 1: Workflow Path Problems
I noticed a potential issue in your workflows. Let me check if this is the problem:

**Problem**: Your workflows have inconsistent working directories:
- Merge workflow: No working directory specified
- PR workflow: Uses `working-directory: ./laundry_scout`

**Solution**: Update your merge workflow to match the PR workflow.

#### Issue 2: Branch Protection
- Make sure you're pushing to the `main` branch (not `master`)
- Check if your default branch is set to `main`

#### Issue 3: Secrets Missing
- Verify `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_LAUNDRY_SCOUT` is properly set
- The secret should contain the full JSON service account key

### Step 3: Quick Fixes to Try

#### Fix 1: Update the Merge Workflow
The merge workflow needs to specify the correct working directory. Here's what needs to be updated:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Setup Flutter
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.7.2'
          
      # Get Flutter dependencies
      - name: Get dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
        working-directory: ./laundry_scout
        
      # Build Flutter web app
      - name: Build Flutter web
        run: flutter build web --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL || 'https://aoyaedzbgollhajvrxiu.supabase.co' }} --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFveWFlZHpiZ29sbGhhanZyeGl1Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDcyNzY1NzUsImV4cCI6MjA2Mjg1MjU3NX0.iShQfGX-jB7798jk6fLim6m_eGpupzPb8lVgEBTMd1U' }}
        working-directory: ./laundry_scout
        
      # Deploy to Firebase
      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          firebaseServiceAccount: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_LAUNDRY_SCOUT }}
          channelId: live
          projectId: laundry-scout
          entryPoint: ./laundry_scout
```
